# Habit Formation Skill

## Key Principles:
1. **Start Small**: Begin with 2-minute versions of new habits
2. **Stack Habits**: Link new habits to existing routines
3. **Track Progress**: Use visual trackers (calendars, apps)
4. **Identity-Based**: Focus on becoming the type of person who does X
5. **Environment Design**: Make good habits obvious and easy

## 21/90 Rule:
- 21 days to build a habit
- 90 days to make it a lifestyle

## Implementation Strategy:
Week 1: Focus on consistency over intensity
Week 2-3: Gradually increase duration/difficulty
Week 4: Evaluate and adjust
        
## Output Format
Always save results to the workspace directory and provide a clear summary to the user.
