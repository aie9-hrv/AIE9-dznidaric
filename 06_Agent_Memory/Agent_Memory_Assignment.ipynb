    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we'll explore **agent memory systems** - the ability for AI agents to remember information across interactions. We'll implement all five memory types from the **CoALA (Cognitive Architectures for Language Agents)** framework while building on our Personal Wellness Assistant use case.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Learning Objectives:**\n",
    "- Understand the 5 memory types from the CoALA framework\n",
    "- Implement short-term memory with checkpointers and thread_id\n",
    "- Build long-term memory with InMemoryStore and namespaces\n",
    "- Use semantic memory for meaning-based retrieval\n",
    "- Apply episodic memory for few-shot learning from past experiences\n",
    "- Create procedural memory for self-improving agents\n",
    "- Combine all memory types into a unified wellness agent\n",

      "\n",
      "Quick starter tips (work for many people)\n",
      "- Keep a consistent wake time: aim to wake up at the same time every day (even weekends). This helps your body  get used to a rhythm.\n",
      "- 60-minute wind-down: start dimming lights, doing a gentle routine (stretching, breathing, or a warm bath). Reduce stress before bed.\n",
      "- Screen rule: avoid phones/computers for at least 60 minutes before bed or use a blue-light filter.\n",
      "- Caffeine cut-off: finish caffeine by early afternoon (e.g., 2–3 pm). If you drink in the evening, that can delay sleep.\n",
      "- Light exposure in the morning: get some sunlight or bright light for 10–30 minutes after waking to help your body's clock.\n",
      "- Sleep environment: keep the room cool (roughly 65–68°F / 18–20°C), dark, and quiet. Use blackout curtains or a white-noise machine if needed.\n",
      "- Bed = sleep zone: only use your bed for sleep (and intimacy). Try not to work or worry in bed.\n",
      "- If you’re awake too long: if you’re unable to fall asleep after 20–30 minutes, get up and do a quiet, dim activity (no screens) until you feel sleepy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Two-week starter plan (gradual, realistic)\n",
      "Week 1\n",
      "- Pick a wake-up time and stick to it daily.\n",
      "- Start a 60-minute pre-bed routine: dim lights, light stretching or a 5-minute breathing exercise (box breathing: 4 seconds in, 4 out, repeat).\n",
      "- No screens after 9:30–10:00 pm (adjust to your bedtime).\n",
      "- Limit caffeine after 2–3 pm. Avoid heavy meals 2–3 hours before bed.\n",
      "- Create a sleep-friendly room: quiet, dark, cool.\n",
      "\n",
      "Week 2\n",
      "- Keep the same wake time. If you’re sleeping too little or waking up a lot, consider a slightly earlier bedtime to target 7–9 hours.\n",
      "- If you’re lying in bed awake for more than 20 minutes, get up and do a dim, quiet activity (no screens) until you feel sleepy.\n",
      "- Add a short morning sunlight exposure (10–15 minutes) soon after waking.\n",
      "- Track your sleep briefly: note bedtime, wake time, rough sleep quality (great, okay, poor). This helps see patterns.\n",
      "\n",
      "A few quick questions so I can tailor this for you:\n",
      "- What time do you usually go to bed and what time do you wake up? Roughly how many hours of sleep do you get on weeknights?\n",
      "- Do you drink caffeine? If yes, when is the last caffeinated drink you have each day?\n",
      "- Do you use screens in the hour before bed? Any blue-light filters on devices?\n",
      "- How’s your sleep quality—do you often wake up during the night or feel tired during the day?\n",
      "- Do you have any health issues or medications that affect sleep, or a snoring/sleep apnea concern?\n",
      "- Do you exercise? If so, when do you usually exercise, and does it feel helpful or disruptive near bedtime?\n",
      "\n",
      "If you’d like, I can build a personalized 1–2 week plan once you share a few details. And if sleep trouble continues for several weeks, it might be worth checking in with a healthcare professional, as they can rule out underlying issues. I’m here to help you through this, Sarah.\n",

    "I dont think there are trade-offs, both are made for different purpose. If we want a simple chat with llm, ask him few questions that are connected we will use short-term memory.

      "- Establish a steady routine: aim for 4–5 movement sessions total.\n",
      "- Mix cardio with gentle strength/mobility: walking, yoga, and swimming.\n",
      "- Build daily stress-relief habits: short mindfulness or breathing, plus good sleep and hydration.\n",
      "- Keep nutrition simple: balanced meals with protein, fiber, and veggies; mindful portions.\n",
      "- Track lightweight progress: what you did, how you felt, and your sleep.\n",
      "\n",
      "Weekly plan (example you can follow or adapt)\n",
      "- Monday: 30-minute brisk or easy-paced walk + 5 minutes of stretch\n",
      "- Tuesday: 20–25 minutes of beginner yoga (gentle flows, breathwork)\n",
      "- Wednesday: 30-minute walk + 5 minutes of simple breathing or a mini body-scan\n",
      "- Thursday: 20–30 minutes swimming (easy laps or water cardio) or, if no pool, another 25–30 minute walk\n",
      "- Friday: Rest or a very light activity (short 15-minute stroll, optional mobility)\n",
      "- Saturday: 20–30 minutes yoga + 10 minutes meditation or deep-breathing\n",
      "- Sunday: 30-minute walk and a quick 5-minute stretch; quick weekly reflection\n",
      "\n",
      "If you have pool access and enjoy swimming, you can swap one walk session for a swim day. If you don’t have swimming access, substitute another 30-minute walk or a 25-minute yoga session.\n",
      "\n",
      "Daily micro-habits to support the week\n",
      "- Hydration: aim for about 2 liters (roughly 8 cups) of water per day; add an extra glass on workout days.\n",
      "- Sleep: target 7–9 hours; try to keep a consistent bedtime and wake-up time.\n",
      "- Stress relief: start or end your day with 5–10 minutes of breathing (box breathing, 4-4-4-4, or simple diaphragmatic breathing).\n",
      "- Nutrition: fill half your plate with veggies at most meals, include a palm-sized portion of protein, and choose a whole grain or fruit for the other half. Have a light protein-rich snack if you’re hungry between meals.\n",
      "\n",
      "Quick tips\n",
      "- Start slow if you’re new to regular activity—it's okay to adjust the duration up next week.\n",
      "- If any activity causes pain, stop and modify (e.g., reduce intensity, switch to a gentler yoga flow, or shorten the session).\n",

      "  - Bent-over row: 3–4 x 8–12\n",
      "  - Overhead press: 3 x 8–12\n",

      "  - Core: 5 minutes (plank variations)\n",
      "\n",
      "- Thursday – Mobility / active recovery\n",
      "  - 20–30 minutes easy cycling or light cardio\n",
      "  - 15–20 minutes mobility/yoga focused on hips, shoulders, ankles\n",
      "  - Gentle breathing work\n",
      "\n",
      "- Friday – Full-body hypertrophy / push-pull balance\n",
      "  - DB/BB row or pull-up variation: 3–4 x 6–10\n",
      "  - Dumbbell bench or incline press: 3–4 x 8–12\n",
      "  - Dumbbell lateral raises: 3 x 12–15\n",

      "- If you’re pressed for time, you can swap Saturday with a longer easy ride and compress the weekday workouts to 45–60 minutes each.\n",
      "- If you don’t have access to heavy weights, replace some movements with dumbbell equivalents or machines while keeping 6–12 rep ranges for hypertrophy.\n",
      "- Progression cue: aim to beat last week’s total reps, or add 1–2 reps or 2–5 lbs more weight on main lifts each week, while keeping good form.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nutrition and recovery quick tips\n",
      "- Protein: target about 1.6–2.2 g per kg of body weight per day (spread across 3–5 meals, with a post-workout meal if possible).\n",
      "- Calories: modest surplus (~250–500 kcal above maintenance) on training days to support muscle gain.\n",
      "- Carbs: emphasize around workouts (pre- and post-workout meals) to fuel performance and recovery.\n",
      "- Fat: keep fats as part of total calories; don’t drop too low.\n",
      "- Sleep: aim for 7–9 hours per night; quality matters as much as quantity.\n",
      "- Hydration: 2–3 L/day baseline, more on intense or hot days.\n",
      "\n",
      "What to track this week\n",
      "- Workouts: weight used, reps completed, and any notes on form or fatigue\n",
      "- Endurance: cycling pace, duration, and perceived effort (RPE)\n",
      "- Recovery signals: resting heart rate, sleep quality, muscle soreness\n",
      "- Nutrition: protein intake and overall calories\n",
      "\n",
      "Want me to tailor this further?\n",
      "- Tell me what equipment you have (barbell, dumbbells, machines, bike), how much time you can dedicate per session, and your typical weekly schedule. I can tailor the plan with exact exercises, set/rep schemes, and a simple progress tracker.\n"

      "Assistant (v1 instructions):\n",
      "Reducing stress is a great goal, and there are several effective strategies you can try. Here are some evidence-based methods:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Mindfulness and Meditation**: Practicing mindfulness or meditation can help you stay present and reduce anxiety. Even a few minutes a day can make a difference.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Physical Activity**: Regular exercise is a powerful stress reliever. It can boost your mood and improve your overall health. Find an activity you enjoy, whether it's walking, dancing, or yoga.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Deep Breathing**: Simple deep breathing exercises can help calm your mind and body. Try inhaling deeply through your nose, holding for a few seconds, and exhaling slowly through your mouth.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Connect with Others**: Talking to friends or family can provide support and help you feel less isolated. Sometimes just sharing your feelings can lighten the load.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Time Management**: Organizing your tasks and setting priorities can help you feel more in control and reduce feelings of overwhelm.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Healthy Eating**: A balanced diet can impact your mood and energy levels. Try to include plenty of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins in your meals.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Sleep Hygiene**: Ensure you’re getting enough quality sleep. Establish a calming bedtime routine and try to go to bed and wake up at the same time each day.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. **Limit Caffeine and Alcohol**: Both can increase feelings of anxiety and disrupt your sleep, so it might be helpful to monitor your intake.\n",
      "\n",

    "##### Answer:\n",
    "Not every interaction is good enough to store. Using like or upvote is a great way to get response. If user said praises that is alsko high-priority episode. There is also successful failure, where users corrects the agent. \n",
    "Storing the raw text isn't enough; structured metadata makes the memory searchable. Fields such as: primary_intent, sentiment_score, context_window, resolution_status and timestamp are of great help later on. Here we are only storing non incriminating, anonimized and filtered data that is useful to us."

    "## ❓ Question #4:\n",
    "\n",
    "For a **production wellness assistant**, which memory types need persistent storage (PostgreSQL) vs in-memory? How would you handle memory across multiple agent instances (e.g., Exercise Agent, Nutrition Agent, Sleep Agent)?\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider:\n",
    "- Which memories are user-specific vs shared?\n",
    "- Consistency requirements across agents\n",
    "- Memory expiration and cleanup policies\n",
    "- Namespace strategy for multi-agent systems\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Answer:\n",
    "In a production environment, the stakes for memory are higher because of scalability, reliability, and consistency. Persistent storage is user profile, historical logs and long-term preferences, in-memory data is from current session, prevoius messages, the thought process of an agent, etc.. User specific data is saved in dedicated user table that must not be shared, such as diseases, injuries; while the shared data could be HealthWellnessGuide that is accessible to all the users.\n",
    "\n",
    "Short-term memory: Should expire after 30–60 minutes of inactivity.\n",
    "Summary Memory: Instead of keeping every chat message, the system should summarize a week’s worth of data into a few key points and delete the raw chat logs to save space.\n",
    "GDPR/Privacy: a hard delete policy for any user who hasn't logged in for over a year.\n",
    "\n",
    "To ensure the Sleep Agent knows what the Exercise Agent did, we should use a centralized state store."

    "\n",
    "In this session, we explored the **5 memory types** from the CoALA framework:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Memory Type | LangGraph Component | Scope | Wellness Use Case |\n",
    "|-------------|---------------------|-------|-------------------|\n",
    "| **Short-term** | `MemorySaver` + `thread_id` | Within thread | Current consultation |\n",
    "| **Long-term** | `InMemoryStore` + namespaces | Across threads | User profile, goals |\n",
    "| **Semantic** | Store + embeddings + `search()` | Across threads | Knowledge retrieval |\n",
    "| **Episodic** | Store + few-shot examples | Across threads | Past successful interactions |\n",
    "| **Procedural** | Store + self-reflection | Across threads | Self-improving instructions |\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Takeaways:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Memory transforms chatbots into assistants** - Persistence enables personalization\n",
    "2. **Different memory types serve different purposes** - Choose based on your use case\n",
    "3. **Context management is critical** - Trim and summarize to stay within limits\n",
    "4. **Episodic memory enables learning** - Show, don't just tell\n",
    "5. **Procedural memory enables adaptation** - Agents can improve themselves\n",
    "\n",
    "### Production Considerations:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use `PostgresSaver` instead of `MemorySaver` for persistent checkpoints\n",
    "- Use `PostgresStore` instead of `InMemoryStore` for persistent long-term memory\n",
    "- Consider TTL (Time-to-Live) policies for automatic memory cleanup\n",
    "- Implement proper access controls for user data\n",
